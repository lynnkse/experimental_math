# Julia Math Functions Project

This project contains two main components: 

- `math_functions` package which provides a set of basic math functions written in Julia. 
- `main.jl` file which demonstrates the use of these functions in a sample script.

## Installation

To use the package, you can install it using Julia's built-in package manager:

pkg> add https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>.git
